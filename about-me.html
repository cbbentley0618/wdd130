    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Hey guys, I'm Connor. I from Phoenix, Arizona. My degree is Computer Science. I haven't dabbled into any coding before, so this is all brand new for me, but I am look forward to it!
        One thing that I really enjoy is cars and working on them. I also enjoy a solid gaming sesh with da boys. I have been a member of the church all my life. </p>
